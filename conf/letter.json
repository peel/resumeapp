    "greeting": "Dear Sir or Madam,",
    "content": "I am writing to apply for the position of Java developer in Gdansk that was advertised on pracuj.pl website. As an engineer and in everyday life I have always followed the rule, that conscious breaking of a standard leads to better results. That is why I am letting myself to diverge from the canon of writing a cover letter.\n I graduated from Gdansk University of Technology with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications in Sound and Image Engineering specialty. Speedy growth and a range of various tasks performed at your company lead me to great interest. My fresh off university knowledge and dynamism might be helpful to you. Despite of my telecommunications knowledge I am also able to develop software using Java, C# and with some further study - using C/C++. Also as a developer I am an author of a face recognition in crowd algorithm that was the practical part of my M.Sc. Eng. thesis. I have conducted extensive unit tests to the project.\n Even though I am a young graduate lacking experience I developed great skills in project management and user experience design that I find a special strength as these arenâ€™t common traits of young engineers.\n I worked as frontend developer and team leader since March 2009 for Pixnet which is based in Gdynia. Prior to this, I worked as a freelance web-designer/developer and sound engineer from 2008to date. Ispeak fluentEnglish andsome Japanese and Spanish.\n I am a well organized, fast-learning, analytic-thinking young engineer. Also I am experienced in working and managing a team. I am accustomed with various work managing tools as well as good at task planning. I am very creative and have vivid acoustic and graphic imagination which lets me find myself in engineering and artistic tasks.\n\n Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss with you in person.",
    "sincerely": "Sincerely"
